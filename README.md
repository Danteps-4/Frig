## Frig project

Frig is a project developed by Dante Augsburger and Santos Zuberbuhler

The objective of Frig is to evaluate the luck of the users through a rock, paper or scissors game. Users have 1 of 3 possibilities to win, lose or draw but we are going to be centered only on the wins. Frig will track your stats and display how lucky you are.
