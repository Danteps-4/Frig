# Frig

Frig is a project developed by [Dante Augsburger](https://github.com/Danteps-4) and [Santos Zuberbuhler](https://github.com/SantosZuber).

## Objective
The objective of Frig is to evaluate the luck of the users through a rock, paper or scissors game. Users have 1 of 3 possibilities to win, lose or draw but we are going to be centered only on the wins. Frig will track your stats and display how lucky you are.

There is no AI implemented in the game, the computer select a random number between 1 and 3, being 1 the rock, 2 the paper and 3 the scissors.

The app collects all the data from the user and save it in a POSTGRESQL database.
