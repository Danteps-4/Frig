# Frig

Frig is a project developed by [Dante Augsburger](https://github.com/Danteps-4) and [Santos Zuberbuhler](https://github.com/SantosZuber).

## Objective
The objective of Frig is to evaluate the luck of the users through a rock, paper or scissors game. Users have 1 of 3 possibilities to win, lose or draw but we are going to be centered only on the wins. Frig will track your stats and display how lucky you are.

There is no AI implemented in the game, the computer select a random number between 1 and 3, being 1 the rock, 2 the paper and 3 the scissors.

The app collects all the data from the user and save it in a POSTGRESQL database.

## How to play

To play you only need to download Frig from the website. You will open it and you can play. For the moment is only available **Rock, paper or scissors** but in the future you will be able to play many different games to try your luck.

On top of the app, there is a bar with different tabs you can click.
